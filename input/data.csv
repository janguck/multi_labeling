펭귄은 원래 갈매기 매처럼 날 수 있었던 새였는데 바닷가에 살면서 물고기를 주식으로 하다 보니 물속으로 잠수해야 할 수 밖에 없는 경우도 있었을 것이다. 잠수를 하다보니 큰 날개와 몸집 때문에 더 깊이 들어가지도 못하게 되니 날개를 자주 쓰지않고 몸은 잠수를 오랫동안 할 수 있게 익숙해지도록 했다. 이 과정을 반복하다보니 날개는 퇴화되었고 몸은 유선형이 되어 날지 못하게 되었다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

또 돌연변이설은 base하여 말해보겠습니다. 원래 모든 장미는 가시가 있는데 한 종이 유전적인 돌연변이를 일으켜 가시가 없는 장미가 만들어 졌습니다. 이 돌연변이 유전자가 대를 거쳐서 번식하게 되어 하나의 종으로 발전하였기 때문이라고 생각합니다.,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

다윈의 진화론에 base하여 말해보겠습니다. 원래 펭귄은 하늘을 날 수 있는 동물이었습니다. 하지만 대륙이동으로 인해 남극으로 집단 이동한 펭귄종들은 남극에서의 풍부한 먹이로 인해 날개를 쓰지 않아도 되어서 퇴화가 되었기 때문이라고 말할 수 있습니다.(물론 몸이 유선형으로 진화되어서 수영하기는 쉬워졌지만요…),0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
돌연변이설에 base하여 말해보겠습니다. 달팽이들은 원래 독성이 없어서 쉽게 2차 소비자(생물)한테 잡아먹히기 쉬웠습니다. 하지만 어떤 종이 돌연변이를 일으켜 독성이 있는 달팽이가 생기고 그 유전자가 대를 이어나가서 하나의 종으로 떨어져 나갔기 때문이라고 생각입니다.,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
원래는 달팽이에게 독이 없고 바다에 사는 미생물이었을 것이며 그 미생물이 육지에 적응을 하여 몸의 구조가 잘 기어 다니게 바뀌었을 것입니다. 그러나 다른 곤충이나 동물들에게 잡아 먹히거나 피해를 당할 일이 많아 질 것입니다. 그래서 달팽이는 자신을 보호하기 위해 세포적인 변화를 몇 백년 몇천년에 걸쳐 변화를 해 독성이 생긴 것 같습니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

펭귄은 원래 날수있는 새에서 파생되나온 날수있는 동물이었지만 빙하가 많은 지역에서 살고 바다등지에서 먹잇감을 구함으로써 철새처럼 따듯한 지역으로 옮겨 다닐 필요가 없었고 한 지방에 계속 머물를수 있었습니다. 따라서 날아다닐 일이 줄어들었고 쓸일이 없었던 날개는 오랜세월에 걸쳐 나는 기능이 많이 떨어졌고 낙후 되었고 결국 날 수 없었던 것이다. 이는 티라노사우르스의 앞쪽의 다리가 쏘지않아 작아진 것과 같다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
느릅나무는 좀더 자신의 개체를 효율적으로 늘리기 위해 생물학적으로 변화를 했을 겁니다. 씨앗의 날개가 없을 때의 느릅나무는 종을 늘리기에 역부족이었기 때문에 이런 변화를 시킨 것입니다. 변화는 무척 오랜시간이 걸렸을겁니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

제 생각에는 달팽이는 자신의 집안으로는 자신을 보호하기에 부족하고 또 과거 자신들의 조상이살았던 환경에 비해 현재의 환경에 더 많은 위험요소들이 있기 때문에 생겼다고 생각합니다. 그 독은 체내에서 보호본능에 의해 스스로 생겨났거나 과거에 없던 새로운 달팽이의 먹이에 있는 어떤 성분이 독을 생성할 수 있는 기능이 있다고 생각합니다.,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
과거에는 건물보다 넓은 토지가 많았던 반면 현재는 그렇지 않으니 느릅나무들의 생존력이 강해져서 더 멀리 잘 자랄수 있는 장소에 도착하기 위해 그렇게 변했을 것. 과거에는 사람들이 심어주었으나 현재에는 여유가 없어진 현대인들이 그렇게 해주지 못하자 스스로 변형됬을것이라고 생각합니다. 또는 사람들은 근친상간을 막는 것처럼 씨앗들은 같은 계통끼리 번식되어 돌연변이가 나오는 것을 막기 위해 변형되었을 것이라 생각합니다.,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
